# libkita

libkita is a small library that makes it easy to create and run child processes, monitor their activity, read their `stdout` and `stderr` output, as well as write to their `stdin`. It is not a _one size fits all_ library; I'm writing this for a particular use-case and the library therefore makes certain assumptions and is lacking a lot of options and features that I don't need for my purposes.
